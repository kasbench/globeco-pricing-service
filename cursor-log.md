Step 1 executed: Configured the project to connect to the PostgreSQL database on host 'globeco-pricing-service-postgresql', port 5435, database 'postgres', user 'postgres' by updating src/main/resources/application.properties with the appropriate datasource properties. 

Step 2 executed: Configured Flyway with the same PostgreSQL connection settings as the datasource by adding flyway.url, flyway.user, flyway.password, and flyway.schemas to src/main/resources/application.properties. 

Step 3 executed: Configured the project to use PostgreSQL Testcontainers by verifying that 'org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter', 'org.testcontainers:postgresql', and 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-testcontainers' dependencies are present in build.gradle. 

Step 4 executed: Created the initial Flyway migration for the schema in src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init_schema.sql using the contents of pricing-service.sql, omitting the CREATE DATABASE statement as required by Flyway best practices. 

Step 5 executed: Created a Java Flyway migration (V2__load_pricing_data.java) in src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_pricing_service/db/migration that (1) randomly selects a date from dates.csv, (2) loads all rows from prices.csv.gz for that date, and (3) inserts them into the price table, letting PostgreSQL generate id and version, as described in the requirements. 

Fixed Flyway migration error: Removed 'ALTER TABLE public.price OWNER TO postgres;' from src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init_schema.sql to resolve the 'role "postgres" does not exist' error during migration in test environments. 

Fixed Flyway Java migration detection: Added 'flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration,classpath:org/kasbench/globeco_pricing_service/db/migration' to src/main/resources/application.properties to ensure Flyway scans both SQL and Java migration locations and runs V2__load_pricing_data.java. 

Fixed Flyway Java migration execution: Renamed the migration class to 'V2__LoadPricingData' (PascalCase) and deleted the old 'V2__load_pricing_data.java' file to match Flyway's naming convention for Java migrations, ensuring it will be detected and run.

Added Flyway Gradle plugin: Updated build.gradle to apply the Flyway Gradle plugin and configured it to use the same datasource and migration locations as the application, enabling flywayClean and flywayMigrate tasks for migration management. 

Updated application.properties: Changed all flyway.* properties to spring.flyway.* so that Spring Boot will use them for automatic migration on startup. Removed the old flyway.* properties. 

Step 6 executed: Implemented the entity (Price), repository (PriceRepository), service interface (PriceService), and service implementation (PriceServiceImpl) for price according to the requirements in @requirements.md. 

Step 7 executed: Implemented unit tests for the Price entity, repository, service interface, and service implementation for price, using test containers as required in step 7 of @execution-plan.md. 

Step 8 executed: Implemented Caffeine caching for price using Spring's caching abstraction with a 5 minute TTL, as required in @requirements.md.

Step 9 executed: Implemented unit tests for price caching to verify cache hits and TTL behavior.

[2024-06-10 10:00] Checked for existing DTOs and mapping utilities in the codebase as part of Step 10 (Implement DTOs) and Step 11 (Implement APIs) from the execution plan. No existing dto package or mapping utilities found. Proceeding to create a PriceDto class and mapping logic consistent with project conventions. 

[2024-06-10 10:01] Created PriceDto class in new dto package, following project conventions and omitting the version field. Includes all relevant fields, constructors, getters, setters, and toString. 

[2024-06-10 10:02] Added mapping methods between Price and PriceDto in PriceService interface, including type conversions and field mapping. Fixed linter errors by using correct entity field names and types, and handling conversion between java.util.Date and java.time.LocalDate.

[2024-06-10 10:03] Started Step 11: Implementing the APIs for price as specified in requirements.md, including the specialized logic for price calculation and endpoint structure.

[2024-06-10 10:04] Created PriceController with /api/v1/prices and /api/v1/price/{ticker} endpoints, implementing the specialized price sampling logic as required. Fixed linter error by setting open, close, high, and low fields in the DTO to the sampled price.

[2024-06-10 10:05] Started Step 12: Implementing tests for the PriceController API endpoints as specified in the execution plan.

[2024-06-10 10:06] Created PriceControllerTest with tests for GET /api/v1/prices, GET /api/v1/price/{ticker}, and 404 error handling, using MockMvc and Mockito to mock the service layer and verify response structure.
