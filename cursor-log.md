Step 1 executed: Configured the project to connect to the PostgreSQL database on host 'globeco-pricing-service-postgresql', port 5435, database 'postgres', user 'postgres' by updating src/main/resources/application.properties with the appropriate datasource properties. 

Step 2 executed: Configured Flyway with the same PostgreSQL connection settings as the datasource by adding flyway.url, flyway.user, flyway.password, and flyway.schemas to src/main/resources/application.properties. 

Step 3 executed: Configured the project to use PostgreSQL Testcontainers by verifying that 'org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter', 'org.testcontainers:postgresql', and 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-testcontainers' dependencies are present in build.gradle. 

Step 4 executed: Created the initial Flyway migration for the schema in src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init_schema.sql using the contents of pricing-service.sql, omitting the CREATE DATABASE statement as required by Flyway best practices. 

Step 5 executed: Created a Java Flyway migration (V2__load_pricing_data.java) in src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_pricing_service/db/migration that (1) randomly selects a date from dates.csv, (2) loads all rows from prices.csv.gz for that date, and (3) inserts them into the price table, letting PostgreSQL generate id and version, as described in the requirements. 

Fixed Flyway migration error: Removed 'ALTER TABLE public.price OWNER TO postgres;' from src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init_schema.sql to resolve the 'role "postgres" does not exist' error during migration in test environments.
