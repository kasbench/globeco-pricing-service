Step 1 executed: Configured the project to connect to the PostgreSQL database on host 'globeco-pricing-service-postgresql', port 5435, database 'postgres', user 'postgres' by updating src/main/resources/application.properties with the appropriate datasource properties. 

Step 2 executed: Configured Flyway with the same PostgreSQL connection settings as the datasource by adding flyway.url, flyway.user, flyway.password, and flyway.schemas to src/main/resources/application.properties. 

Step 3 executed: Configured the project to use PostgreSQL Testcontainers by verifying that 'org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter', 'org.testcontainers:postgresql', and 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-testcontainers' dependencies are present in build.gradle. 

Step 4 executed: Created the initial Flyway migration for the schema in src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init_schema.sql using the contents of pricing-service.sql, omitting the CREATE DATABASE statement as required by Flyway best practices. 

Step 5 executed: Created a Java Flyway migration (V2__load_pricing_data.java) in src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_pricing_service/db/migration that (1) randomly selects a date from dates.csv, (2) loads all rows from prices.csv.gz for that date, and (3) inserts them into the price table, letting PostgreSQL generate id and version, as described in the requirements. 

Fixed Flyway migration error: Removed 'ALTER TABLE public.price OWNER TO postgres;' from src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init_schema.sql to resolve the 'role "postgres" does not exist' error during migration in test environments. 

Fixed Flyway Java migration detection: Added 'flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration,classpath:org/kasbench/globeco_pricing_service/db/migration' to src/main/resources/application.properties to ensure Flyway scans both SQL and Java migration locations and runs V2__load_pricing_data.java. 

Fixed Flyway Java migration execution: Renamed the migration class to 'V2__LoadPricingData' (PascalCase) and deleted the old 'V2__load_pricing_data.java' file to match Flyway's naming convention for Java migrations, ensuring it will be detected and run.

Added Flyway Gradle plugin: Updated build.gradle to apply the Flyway Gradle plugin and configured it to use the same datasource and migration locations as the application, enabling flywayClean and flywayMigrate tasks for migration management. 

Updated application.properties: Changed all flyway.* properties to spring.flyway.* so that Spring Boot will use them for automatic migration on startup. Removed the old flyway.* properties. 

Step 6 executed: Implemented the entity (Price), repository (PriceRepository), service interface (PriceService), and service implementation (PriceServiceImpl) for price according to the requirements in @requirements.md. 

Step 7 executed: Implemented unit tests for the Price entity, repository, service interface, and service implementation for price, using test containers as required in step 7 of @execution-plan.md. 

Step 8 executed: Implemented Caffeine caching for price using Spring's caching abstraction with a 5 minute TTL, as required in @requirements.md.

Step 9 executed: Implemented unit tests for price caching to verify cache hits and TTL behavior.

[2024-06-10 10:00] Checked for existing DTOs and mapping utilities in the codebase as part of Step 10 (Implement DTOs) and Step 11 (Implement APIs) from the execution plan. No existing dto package or mapping utilities found. Proceeding to create a PriceDto class and mapping logic consistent with project conventions. 

[2024-06-10 10:01] Created PriceDto class in new dto package, following project conventions and omitting the version field. Includes all relevant fields, constructors, getters, setters, and toString. 

[2024-06-10 10:02] Added mapping methods between Price and PriceDto in PriceService interface, including type conversions and field mapping. Fixed linter errors by using correct entity field names and types, and handling conversion between java.util.Date and java.time.LocalDate.

[2024-06-10 10:03] Started Step 11: Implementing the APIs for price as specified in requirements.md, including the specialized logic for price calculation and endpoint structure.

[2024-06-10 10:04] Created PriceController with /api/v1/prices and /api/v1/price/{ticker} endpoints, implementing the specialized price sampling logic as required. Fixed linter error by setting open, close, high, and low fields in the DTO to the sampled price.

[2024-06-10 10:05] Started Step 12: Implementing tests for the PriceController API endpoints as specified in the execution plan.

[2024-06-10 10:06] Created PriceControllerTest with tests for GET /api/v1/prices, GET /api/v1/price/{ticker}, and 404 error handling, using MockMvc and Mockito to mock the service layer and verify response structure.

[2024-06-10 10:07] Started Step 13: Implementing liveness, readiness, and startup health checks for the service as required for Kubernetes deployment.

[2024-06-10 10:08] Added actuator and management configuration for liveness, readiness, and startup health checks in application.properties, and documented these endpoints in README.md for Kubernetes deployment.

[2024-06-10 10:09] Started Step 14: Completing documentation for the service in README.md as required by the execution plan.

[2024-06-10 10:10] Completed service documentation in README.md, including overview, technology stack, database info, API endpoints, caching, migrations, testing, health checks, and deployment notes.

[2024-06-10 10:11] Started Step 15: Creating a Dockerfile for the application as required by the execution plan.

[2024-06-10 10:13] Started Step 16: Creating Kubernetes deployment files for the application, including liveness, readiness, and startup probes, resource limits, and scaling configuration as specified in the execution plan.

[2024-06-10 10:14] Created Kubernetes deployment, service, and HPA manifests with liveness, readiness, and startup probes, resource limits, scaling, and documented deployment in README.md.

[2024-06-10 10:15] Started Step 17: Exposing the OpenAPI schema as an endpoint using Springdoc OpenAPI as required by the execution plan.

[2024-06-10 10:16] Completed Step 17: OpenAPI schema and Swagger UI are now exposed via Springdoc, with endpoints documented in README.md.

[2024-06-10 10:17] Fixed bug in PriceService.toDto: now converts java.sql.Date to LocalDate using toLocalDate(), preventing UnsupportedOperationException when calling /api/v1/prices.

[2024-06-10 10:18] Fixed test failures in PriceControllerTest by using java.sql.Date for priceDate in all Price entity constructions, matching the type expected by the toDto method and preventing ClassCastException.

2024-06-09: Added global CORS configuration to allow any origin for all endpoints by creating a WebMvcConfigurer bean in GlobecoPricingServiceApplication.java. This enables CORS for all HTTP methods and headers, as required.

**Request:** Generate a Kubernetes manifest to deploy PostgreSQL in the globeco namespace, using the provided Docker run statement as a guide, and place the manifest in the k8s directory.

**Action:** Created k8s/globeco-postgresql-deployment.yaml with a Namespace, Deployment, and Service for PostgreSQL, matching the image, ports, environment variable, and listen_addresses configuration from the Docker run example. No persistent storage was configured as per the request.

---

**Request:** Update the PostgreSQL manifest to use storage with storage class `storage-local` and clarify if a StatefulSet should be used. User confirmed single replica.

**Action:** Updated k8s/globeco-postgresql-deployment.yaml to use a StatefulSet with a single replica, added a PersistentVolumeClaim template using the storage-local StorageClass, included a headless Service for stable network identity, and retained the ClusterIP Service for access. Storage size set to 10Gi.

---

**Request:** Fix PostgreSQL StatefulSet manifest error caused by mounting directly to /var/lib/postgresql/data (lost+found directory issue). User approved solution.

**Action:** Updated k8s/globeco-postgresql-deployment.yaml to mount the volume at /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata and set the PGDATA environment variable accordingly. This avoids the lost+found directory issue and allows PostgreSQL to initialize properly.

---

**Request:** Further fix for PostgreSQL StatefulSet manifest error (lost+found directory still present). User approved solution to use a deeper subdirectory.

**Action:** Updated k8s/globeco-postgresql-deployment.yaml to mount the volume at /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata/data and set the PGDATA environment variable to match. This ensures the data directory is empty and avoids the lost+found directory issue with local storage.

---

**Request:** Fix PostgreSQL StatefulSet manifest that keeps failing with lost+found directory error despite nested subdirectories. User requested best approach.

**Action:** Updated k8s/globeco-postgresql-deployment.yaml to use an init container that creates a clean subdirectory (/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata) for PostgreSQL data. The init container ensures proper ownership (999:999) and permissions (700) for the data directory, avoiding the lost+found directory issue with local storage.

---

**Request:** Analyze startup logs to identify why actuator probes hang in Kubernetes. Application takes ~15 seconds to start but probes were configured with only 10 seconds initial delay.

**Action:** Updated k8s/globeco-pricing-service-deployment.yaml probe configuration: increased initialDelaySeconds to 20 (allowing for 15-second startup), reduced timeoutSeconds from 240 to 5 (more reasonable), and optimized periodSeconds for better responsiveness. This should resolve the hanging probe issue.

---

**Request:** Application still hanging with probes enabled. New logs show startup takes 35+ seconds (not 15s), and connection refused errors from debug pod indicate readiness issues.

**Action:** Updated k8s/globeco-pricing-service-deployment.yaml with increased startup probe timeout: initialDelaySeconds to 30, failureThreshold to 24 (120s total), and increased liveness/readiness initialDelaySeconds to 40 to account for the actual 35+ second startup time.

---

**Request:** Configure the application to send metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector, using the instructions provided in OTEL_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md.

**Action:** Added Micrometer and OpenTelemetry dependencies to build.gradle. Configured application.properties to export metrics to the collector at otel-collector-collector.default.svc.cluster.local:4317 using OTLP/gRPC, with insecure connection and service name set to globeco-pricing-service.


**Request:** Fix OTLP metrics configuration issue where application was publishing to localhost:4318 instead of the configured gRPC endpoint. User reported connection refused errors in logs.

**Action:** Fixed OTLP configuration by using the correct Spring Boot property names. Changed from incorrect `management.metrics.export.otlp.*` to correct `management.otlp.metrics.export.*` properties. Configured `management.otlp.metrics.export.url=http://otel-collector-collector.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4317` to use the gRPC OTLP endpoint as specified in OTEL_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md. The application was ignoring the previous configuration due to wrong property names.
